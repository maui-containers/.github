# .NET MAUI Containers

**Containerized and virtualized environments for .NET MAUI development, testing, and CI/CD across all platforms.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The **maui-containers** organization provides pre-built, reproducible environments for .NET MAUI developers — spanning **Docker images** (Linux/Windows) and **macOS virtual machines** (via Tart).  
Each image is optimized for building, testing, and shipping .NET MAUI apps without the pain of manually configuring SDKs, workloads, or emulators.
